# Customer Tier Not Upgrading Fix

**Date:** October 4, 2025  
**Issue:** Customer has 658 lifetime points (enough for SILVER) but shows as BRONZE tier

---

## üîç Problem Analysis

### Customer: Saddaul Siam

**Current Situation:**

- **Lifetime Points:** 658 (total earned)
- **Current Points:** 23 (available to spend)
- **Current Tier:** BRONZE ‚ùå (should be SILVER!)
- **Progress Display:** "Progress to SILVER: 0 points to go, 100%" (because already qualified!)

**Why This Happened:**

- Customer earned 658 points total
- Customer spent 635 points (leaving 23 available)
- **Tier was never upgraded when they crossed 500 lifetime points**

**Root Cause:** The system doesn't automatically upgrade tiers when points are earned. The tier field in the database
needs to be manually updated based on lifetime points.

---

## ‚úÖ How Tiers SHOULD Work

### Tier Qualification Based on LIFETIME Points:

| Tier        | Minimum Lifetime Points | Benefits                                      |
| ----------- | ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| ü•â BRONZE   | 0                       | 1.0x multiplier, 0% discount, 50pt birthday   |
| ü•à SILVER   | 500                     | 1.25x multiplier, 5% discount, 100pt birthday |
| ü•á GOLD     | 1500                    | 1.5x multiplier, 10% discount, 200pt birthday |
| üíé PLATINUM | 3000                    | 2.0x multiplier, 15% discount, 500pt birthday |

**Important:** Tier is based on **LIFETIME POINTS** (total earned), NOT current available points!

### Example:

**Customer Journey:**

1. Starts at BRONZE (0 lifetime points)
2. Makes purchases, earns 600 points ‚Üí **Upgrades to SILVER** (600 >= 500)
3. Redeems 400 points for rewards ‚Üí Still SILVER! (lifetime still 600)
4. Current balance: 200 points
5. Tier: SILVER (based on 600 lifetime, not 200 current)

**Saddaul Siam's Case:**

1. Earned 658 lifetime points ‚úÖ
2. Spent 635 points (23 remaining) ‚úÖ
3. **Should be SILVER** (658 >= 500) ‚úÖ
4. But tier field was never updated ‚ùå

---

## üîß Fix Applied

### Script Created: `updateCustomerTiers.js`

This script:

1. ‚úÖ Calculates lifetime points for each customer
2. ‚úÖ Determines correct tier based on lifetime points
3. ‚úÖ Updates customer tier in database
4. ‚úÖ Creates transaction record for tier change

### Results:

```
Customer: Saddaul Siam (ID: 2)
  Current Points: 23
  Lifetime Points: 658
  Current Tier: BRONZE
  Correct Tier: SILVER
  ‚ö†Ô∏è  MISMATCH! Updating BRONZE ‚Üí SILVER...
  ‚úÖ Updated to SILVER!
```

**Saddaul Siam is now SILVER tier!** ü•à

## üéØ What Changed

### Before Fix:

```
Customer: Saddaul Siam
‚îú‚îÄ Lifetime Points: 658
‚îú‚îÄ Current Points: 23
‚îú‚îÄ Tier: BRONZE ‚ùå
‚îú‚îÄ Progress to SILVER: 0 points to go (158% progress!)
‚îî‚îÄ Benefits: 1.0x multiplier, 0% discount
```

### After Fix:

```
Customer: Saddaul Siam
‚îú‚îÄ Lifetime Points: 658
‚îú‚îÄ Current Points: 23
‚îú‚îÄ Tier: SILVER ‚úÖ
‚îú‚îÄ Progress to GOLD: 842 points to go (15.8% progress)
‚îî‚îÄ Benefits: 1.25x multiplier, 5% discount
```

## üìä Expected UI Display (After Refresh)

### Loyalty Dashboard:

```
Current Tier
ü•à SILVER

Available Points: 23
Lifetime Points: 658
Available Rewards: 0

Progress to GOLD
[####                                ] 15.8%
842 points to go

Your Benefits:
‚úì Earn 1.25x points on purchases
‚úì Discount: 5% on all items
‚úì Birthday bonus: 100 points
```

### Calculation Breakdown:

**Progress to GOLD:**

- Current Tier: SILVER (min: 500)
- Next Tier: GOLD (min: 1500)
- Lifetime Points: 658

```
Points in current tier = 658 - 500 = 158
Points needed for next tier = 1500 - 500 = 1000
Progress = (158 / 1000) √ó 100 = 15.8%

Points to go = 1500 - 658 = 842
```

## üöÄ How to Apply the Fix

### For This Specific Customer:

**Already Fixed!** The script ran and updated Saddaul Siam to SILVER.

**To see the change:**

1. Refresh the customer page in the browser (F5 or Ctrl+R)
2. Or click the "Refresh" button in the Loyalty Program tab
3. Tier should now show SILVER ü•à

### For All Customers (If Needed Again):

```bash
cd backend
node src/scripts/updateCustomerTiers.js
```

This will:

- Check all customers
- Calculate their lifetime points
- Upgrade any customers whose tier doesn't match their lifetime points
- Show a summary of changes

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Preventing Future Issues

### Option 1: Manual Tier Checks (Current)

Periodically run:

```bash
node src/scripts/updateCustomerTiers.js
```

### Option 2: Automatic Tier Upgrade (Recommended)

Add tier upgrade logic to the points earning function:

```javascript
// In backend/src/routes/loyalty.js or wherever points are awarded

async function awardPoints(customerId, points) {
  // 1. Add points
  await prisma.customer.update({
    where: { id: customerId },
    data: { loyaltyPoints: { increment: points } },
  });

  // 2. Create transaction
  await prisma.pointsTransaction.create({
    data: { customerId, type: "EARNED", points, description: "Purchase" },
  });

  // 3. Calculate lifetime points
  const earnedPoints = await prisma.pointsTransaction.aggregate({
    where: { customerId, points: { gt: 0 } },
    _sum: { points: true },
  });
  const lifetimePoints = earnedPoints._sum.points || 0;

  // 4. Determine correct tier
  let newTier = "BRONZE";
  if (lifetimePoints >= 3000) newTier = "PLATINUM";
  else if (lifetimePoints >= 1500) newTier = "GOLD";
  else if (lifetimePoints >= 500) newTier = "SILVER";

  // 5. Update tier if changed
  const customer = await prisma.customer.findUnique({
    where: { id: customerId },
    select: { loyaltyTier: true },
  });

  if (customer.loyaltyTier !== newTier) {
    await prisma.customer.update({
      where: { id: customerId },
      data: { loyaltyTier: newTier },
    });

    // Log tier upgrade
    await prisma.pointsTransaction.create({
      data: {
        customerId,
        type: "ADJUSTED",
        points: 0,
        description: `Tier upgraded from ${customer.loyaltyTier} to ${newTier}`,
      },
    });

    console.log(`üéâ Customer ${customerId} upgraded to ${newTier}!`);
  }
}
```

### Option 3: Database Trigger (Advanced)

Create a database trigger that automatically updates tier when transactions are added:

```sql
-- PostgreSQL/MySQL example (SQLite has limited trigger support)
CREATE TRIGGER auto_update_tier
AFTER INSERT ON PointsTransaction
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
  -- Calculate lifetime points
  -- Update customer tier based on total
END;
```

---

## üìã Verification Checklist

After running the fix:

- [ ] Database shows customer tier as SILVER

  ```sql
  SELECT id, name, loyaltyPoints, loyaltyTier
  FROM Customer WHERE id = 2;
  -- Should show: loyaltyTier = "SILVER"
  ```

- [ ] Backend API returns SILVER tier

  ```bash
  # Test the endpoint
  curl http://localhost:3000/api/loyalty/customers/2/loyalty-status
  # Should show: tier.current = "SILVER"
  ```

- [ ] Frontend UI displays SILVER tier

  - Refresh browser
  - Check "Current Tier" badge shows ü•à SILVER
  - Check benefits show 1.25x multiplier, 5% discount
  - Check progress shows "Progress to GOLD"

- [ ] Console logs show correct values
  ```javascript
  Parsed Data: {
    currentTier: "SILVER",
    lifetimePoints: 658,
    nextTier: "GOLD",
    pointsToNextTier: 842,
    progressPercentage: "15.80%"
  }
  ```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue: UI still shows BRONZE after running script

**Solution 1: Hard Refresh**

- Press Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows/Linux)
- Or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
- Clears browser cache

**Solution 2: Check Backend**

```bash
cd backend
node src/scripts/analyzeTransactions.js
```

Look for customer's tier in output.

**Solution 3: Restart Backend Server** If backend is running, restart it:

```bash
# Stop server (Ctrl+C)
# Start again
npm run dev
```

### Issue: Script says tier is correct but UI is wrong

**Check database directly:**

```bash
cd backend
npx prisma studio
```

Navigate to Customer table, find customer ID 2, check `loyaltyTier` field.

### Issue: Tier keeps resetting to BRONZE

**Possible causes:**

1. Another process is overwriting the tier
2. Code somewhere is setting tier based on current points instead of lifetime
3. Database constraint or trigger

**Debug:** Check all places in code that update `loyaltyTier` field.
