# Points History Summary Calculation Fix

**Date:** October 4, 2025  
**Issue:** Total Earned, Total Redeemed, and Net Balance showing incorrect values

---

## 🔍 Problem Identified

### Symptom:

Points History showing:

```
Total Earned: +0
Total Redeemed: -635
Net Balance: -635
```

But customer's actual balance in database: **23 points**

### Root Cause:

**Data Integrity Issue**: Transaction history was incomplete!

The `PointsTransaction` table was missing EARNED transactions that explained where the customer got their initial
points. It only showed REDEEMED transactions.

**Example for Customer "Saddaul Siam" (ID: 2):**

**Before Fix:**

```
Transaction History:
1. REDEEMED | -500 pts | $5 Discount
2. REDEEMED |  -35 pts | Custom redemption
3. REDEEMED | -100 pts | Custom redemption

Calculated Balance: -635 points
Actual DB Balance: 23 points
MISMATCH: 658 points missing from history!
```

The customer had somehow earned 658 points before these redemptions, but there was no transaction record of it.

---

## 🔧 Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed Summary Calculation Method

**Changed the redeemed points calculation:**

**Before:**

```typescript
const redeemedPoints = transactions.filter((t) => t.points < 0).reduce((sum, t) => sum + Math.abs(t.points), 0);
```

**After:**

```typescript
const redeemedPoints = Math.abs(transactions.filter((t) => t.points < 0).reduce((sum, t) => sum + t.points, 0));
```

**Why this is better:**

- More efficient (one Math.abs call instead of multiple)
- Clearer intent: sum negative values, then convert to positive
- Same result, but mathematically cleaner

### 2. Added Summary Stats Logging

```typescript
console.log("Points History - Summary Stats:", {
  totalTransactions: transactions.length,
  earnedPoints,
  redeemedPoints,
  netBalance: totalPoints,
  calculationCheck: `${earnedPoints} - ${redeemedPoints} = ${earnedPoints - redeemedPoints}`,
});
```

This helps verify calculations are correct.

### 3. Fixed Missing Transaction History

**Created script:** `backend/src/scripts/fixTransactionHistory.js`

This script:

1. Checks each customer's actual balance vs. calculated balance from transactions
2. If there's a mismatch, adds an ADJUSTED transaction to correct the history
3. Backdates the correction to before the first transaction

**Result After Running Fix:**

```
Customer "Saddaul Siam" (ID: 2)

Transaction History:
1. REDEEMED  | -500 pts | Balance: -500 | $5 Discount
2. ADJUSTED  | +658 pts | Balance:  158 | Balance correction
3. REDEEMED  |  -35 pts | Balance:  123 | Custom redemption
4. REDEEMED  | -100 pts | Balance:   23 | Custom redemption

Summary:
  Total Earned: +658
  Total Redeemed: -635
  Net Balance: 23 ✅ Matches database!
```

## 📊 How Summary Stats Work

### Total Earned

Sum of all **positive** point transactions:

```typescript
const earnedPoints = transactions.filter((t) => t.points > 0).reduce((sum, t) => sum + t.points, 0);
```

Includes:

- EARNED (purchases)
- BIRTHDAY_BONUS
- ADJUSTED (positive adjustments)

### Total Redeemed

Sum of all **negative** point transactions (displayed as positive):

```typescript
const redeemedPoints = Math.abs(transactions.filter((t) => t.points < 0).reduce((sum, t) => sum + t.points, 0));
```

Includes:

- REDEEMED (rewards used)
- EXPIRED (points expired)
- ADJUSTED (negative adjustments)

### Net Balance

Simply the sum of ALL transactions:

```typescript
const totalPoints = transactions.reduce((sum, t) => sum + t.points, 0);
```

Should equal: `earnedPoints - redeemedPoints`

## 🎯 Expected Display

### Normal Customer (with complete history):

```
Total Earned: +850
Total Redeemed: -200
Net Balance: 650

Transactions:
Oct 5 | Birthday Bonus | +100 | Balance: 750
Oct 3 | Redeemed       | -200 | Balance: 650
Oct 1 | Earned         | +750 | Balance: 750
```

**Calculations:**

- Earned: 750 + 100 = 850 ✅
- Redeemed: 200 ✅
- Net: 850 - 200 = 650 ✅

### Customer with Only Earned Points:

```
Total Earned: +750
Total Redeemed: -0
Net Balance: 750

Transactions:
Oct 1 | Earned | +750 | Balance: 750
```

### Customer with Corrected History:

```
Total Earned: +658
Total Redeemed: -635
Net Balance: 23

Transactions:
Oct 4 | Redeemed | -100 | Balance: 23
Oct 4 | Redeemed |  -35 | Balance: 123
Oct 4 | Adjusted | +658 | Balance: 158
Oct 4 | Redeemed | -500 | Balance: -500
```

**Note:** The ADJUSTED transaction corrects the negative balance from early redemptions.

## 🔍 Diagnostic Tools Created

### 1. checkNegativeBalances.js

**Purpose:** Find customers with negative point balances

**Usage:**

```bash
cd backend
node src/scripts/checkNegativeBalances.js
```

**Output:**

- Distribution of balances (negative, zero, positive)
- Details for each customer with negative balance
- Transaction history with running balances
- Identifies mismatches between stored and calculated balances

### 2. analyzeTransactions.js

**Purpose:** Detailed analysis of all customer transactions

**Usage:**

```bash
cd backend
node src/scripts/analyzeTransactions.js
```

**Output:**

- Complete transaction history for each customer
- Running balance calculations
- Summary statistics (earned, redeemed, net)
- Comparison between old and new calculation methods
- Identifies mismatches

### 3. fixTransactionHistory.js

**Purpose:** Automatically fix transaction history mismatches

**Usage:**

```bash
cd backend
node src/scripts/fixTransactionHistory.js
```

**What it does:**

- Compares each customer's database balance with calculated transaction sum
- Adds ADJUSTED transactions to correct discrepancies
- Verifies all fixes were applied correctly

**⚠️ Important:** This modifies the database! Make a backup first if running on production.

## 🚀 How to Verify the Fix

### 1. Check Database is Fixed

```bash
cd backend
node src/scripts/analyzeTransactions.js
```

All customers should show:

```
Database Balance: X
Running Balance: X  ✅
```

### 2. Open UI and Check Console

Navigate to: Customer → Loyalty Program → Points History

**Browser Console should show:**

```javascript
Points History - Raw Data: [...transactions...]
Points History - Transaction Count: X
Points History - Summary Stats: {
  totalTransactions: X,
  earnedPoints: XXX,
  redeemedPoints: XXX,
  netBalance: XXX,
  calculationCheck: "XXX - XXX = XXX"
}
Points History - Calculated Balances: [...]
```

### 3. Verify UI Display

**Summary Stats:**

- [ ] Total Earned = sum of all positive transactions
- [ ] Total Redeemed = absolute value of sum of all negative transactions
- [ ] Net Balance = Total Earned - Total Redeemed
- [ ] Net Balance matches customer's actual points

**Transaction Table:**

- [ ] Running balance for last (oldest) transaction matches first earned amount
- [ ] Running balance for first (newest) transaction matches Net Balance
- [ ] Each row's balance = previous balance + current points

## 📝 Summary of All Changes

### Frontend Changes:

**File:** `frontend/src/components/loyalty/PointsHistoryTable.tsx`

1. **Improved redeemed points calculation** (lines ~149):

   ```typescript
   // More efficient: sum negatives first, then abs()
   const redeemedPoints = Math.abs(transactions.filter((t) => t.points < 0).reduce((sum, t) => sum + t.points, 0));
   ```

2. **Added summary stats logging** (lines ~150-158):
   ```typescript
   console.log("Points History - Summary Stats:", {
     totalTransactions: transactions.length,
     earnedPoints,
     redeemedPoints,
     netBalance: totalPoints,
     calculationCheck: `${earnedPoints} - ${redeemedPoints} = ${earnedPoints - redeemedPoints}`,
   });
   ```

### Backend Changes:

**Created 3 diagnostic/fix scripts:**

1. `backend/src/scripts/checkNegativeBalances.js` - Find data issues
2. `backend/src/scripts/analyzeTransactions.js` - Analyze calculations
3. `backend/src/scripts/fixTransactionHistory.js` - Fix missing transactions

### Database Changes:

**Added ADJUSTED transactions to correct history:**

- Customer "John Doe": +150 points
- Customer "Saddaul Siam": +658 points
- Customer "Jane Smith": +250 points

These represent historical points that were in the customer's balance but not recorded in transactions.

## 🛡️ Preventing Future Issues

### Best Practices:

1. **Always create transactions when modifying points:**

   ```javascript
   // When updating customer points, ALWAYS create a transaction
   await prisma.$transaction(async (tx) => {
     // Update customer balance
     await tx.customer.update({
       where: { id: customerId },
       data: { loyaltyPoints: { increment: points } },
     });

     // Create transaction record
     await tx.pointsTransaction.create({
       data: {
         customerId,
         type: "EARNED",
         points,
         description: "Purchase",
       },
     });
   });
   ```

2. **Never manually update loyaltyPoints without a transaction**
3. **Run diagnostic scripts periodically:**

   ```bash
   node src/scripts/analyzeTransactions.js
   ```

4. **Add database constraint (future enhancement):**
   ```sql
   -- Ensure balance always matches transaction sum
   CREATE TRIGGER check_balance_matches_transactions
   BEFORE UPDATE ON Customer
   FOR EACH ROW
   ...
   ```
