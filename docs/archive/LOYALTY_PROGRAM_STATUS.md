### Recent Bug Fixes (October 4, 2025)

✅ **Fixed: Statistics Endpoint Array Nesting Bug**

- **Issue:** `authorizeRoles(["ADMIN", "MANAGER"])` wrapped in route array caused double nesting
- **Impact:** All admin endpoints returning 403 even with correct role
- **Fixed:** Removed array wrapper, now `authorizeRoles("ADMIN", "MANAGER")`
- **Affected Endpoints:** 7 endpoints (statistics, offers CRUD, tier config)

✅ **Fixed: Statistics customersByTier Formatting**

- **Issue:** Prisma `_count` object not properly extracted
- **Fixed:** Proper extraction of `_count.loyaltyTier || _count._all`
- **Result:** Statistics now return correct tier distribution

✅ **Enhanced: Authentication Middleware**

- Added extensive debug logging to `authenticateToken` and `authorizeRoles`
- Created `optionalAuth` middleware for public/admin dual endpoints
- Improved error messages and troubleshooting
