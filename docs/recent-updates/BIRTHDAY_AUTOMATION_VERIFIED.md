## ⏰ Automation Schedule

**When It Runs:**
- 🕘 **Daily at 9:00 AM** (automatically)
- Checks all customers for birthdays
- Awards points based on loyalty tier
- Prevents duplicate bonuses (only once per day)

**How It Works:**
1. Scheduler wakes up at 9:00 AM
2. Queries all active customers with birthdays today
3. Checks if bonus already awarded today
4. Awards tier-specific bonus points
5. Creates transaction record for audit trail
6. Logs results to console

## 📊 Console Output Example

**When server starts:**
```
⏰ Birthday Rewards Scheduler Starting...
✅ Birthday rewards scheduler is running
📆 Schedule: Daily at 9:00 AM
🎂 Automatically checks for birthdays and awards bonuses
```

**When 9:00 AM arrives:**
```
📅 ==========================================
   Scheduled Birthday Rewards Check
   Time: 10/5/2025, 9:00:00 AM
==========================================

🎂 Checking for birthdays on 10/5/2025...
🎉 Found 1 birthday today!

  🎁 Birthday Test Customer (BRONZE): +50 points

✅ Birthday rewards complete: 1/1 customers awarded

🎊 Success! Awarded bonuses to 1 customers
```

**When no birthdays:**
```
🎂 Checking for birthdays on 10/6/2025...
✅ No birthdays today - all clear!
```

---

## 🛡️ Safety Features

### Duplicate Prevention
- ✅ Only awards bonus **once per day** per customer
- ✅ Checks for existing `BIRTHDAY_BONUS` transaction today
- ✅ Skips if already awarded
- ✅ Logs skipped customers

### Error Handling
- ✅ Try-catch around each customer
- ✅ Continues if one customer fails
- ✅ Logs all errors
- ✅ Returns success count

### Audit Trail
- ✅ Every bonus creates a `PointsTransaction` record
- ✅ Includes customer ID, points, tier, timestamp
- ✅ Searchable and reportable
- ✅ Visible in Points History

---

## 📈 Database Impact

**Daily Query Load:**
- 1 query to get all active customers with birthdays
- N queries to check existing bonuses (where N = birthday count)
- N transactions to award points (where N = birthday count)

**Average:** ~1-5 queries per day (unless you have many birthdays)

**Performance:** Negligible - runs in milliseconds

---

## 🔧 Configuration

### Change Schedule Time
Edit `backend/src/scheduler.js` line 161:

```javascript
// Current: Daily at 9:00 AM
cron.schedule("0 9 * * *", async () => {
  // ...
});

// Examples:
// Midnight: "0 0 * * *"
// Noon: "0 12 * * *"
// Every hour: "0 * * * *"
```

### Change Bonus Amounts
Edit `backend/src/routes/loyalty.js` lines 12-15:

```javascript
const LOYALTY_TIERS = {
  BRONZE: { birthdayBonus: 50 },    // Change this
  SILVER: { birthdayBonus: 100 },   // Change this
  GOLD: { birthdayBonus: 200 },     // Change this
  PLATINUM: { birthdayBonus: 500 }, // Change this
};
```

**⚠️ Note:** Also update the same values in `backend/src/scheduler.js` lines 9-14

### Disable Automation
Comment out in `backend/src/index.js` line 117:

```javascript
// startScheduler(); // Disable birthday automation
```
