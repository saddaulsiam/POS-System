# Tier Never Downgrades & Progress Reset System

**Date:** October 4, 2025  
**Feature:** Tiers never downgrade + Progress resets after tier upgrade

---

## 🎯 New Tier System Rules

### Rule 1: Tiers NEVER Go Down ⬆️

Once a customer reaches a tier, they **keep it forever**, even if they spend all their points.

**Example:**

```
Customer earns 1500 points → Upgraded to GOLD 🥇
Customer spends 1400 points (100 remaining)
Customer tier: Still GOLD 🥇 (never downgrades!)

Lifetime points: 1500
Current points: 100
Tier: GOLD (permanent!)
```

### Rule 2: Progress Resets After Tier Upgrade 🔄

When upgraded to a new tier, progress starts from **0%** toward the next tier.

**Before (Old System):**

```
Customer at SILVER with 658 lifetime points
Progress to GOLD calculated from ZERO:
  658 / 1500 = 43.8% progress

Problem: Customer already "used up" 500 points to get to SILVER!
```

**After (New System):**

```
Customer at SILVER with 658 lifetime points
Progress to GOLD calculated from SILVER minimum (500):
  (658 - 500) / (1500 - 500) = 158 / 1000 = 15.8% progress ✅

Correct! Progress shows how far through SILVER tier, not total lifetime.
```

## 📊 How Progress Calculation Works

### Tier Ranges:

| Tier        | Minimum | Range       | Next Tier At    |
| ----------- | ------- | ----------- | --------------- |
| 🥉 BRONZE   | 0       | 0 - 499     | 500 (SILVER)    |
| 🥈 SILVER   | 500     | 500 - 1499  | 1500 (GOLD)     |
| 🥇 GOLD     | 1500    | 1500 - 2999 | 3000 (PLATINUM) |
| 💎 PLATINUM | 3000    | 3000+       | Max tier        |

### Progress Formula:

```javascript
pointsInCurrentTier = lifetimePoints - currentTierMinimum
totalPointsInTier = nextTierMinimum - currentTierMinimum
progressPercentage = (pointsInCurrentTier / totalPointsInTier) × 100
pointsStillNeeded = totalPointsInTier - pointsInCurrentTier
```

### Example 1: BRONZE with 250 lifetime points

```
Current Tier: BRONZE (min: 0)
Next Tier: SILVER (min: 500)
Lifetime Points: 250

pointsInCurrentTier = 250 - 0 = 250
totalPointsInTier = 500 - 0 = 500
progressPercentage = (250 / 500) × 100 = 50%
pointsStillNeeded = 500 - 250 = 250

Display:
  "Progress to SILVER"
  [####################                    ] 50%
  "250 points to go"
```

### Example 2: SILVER with 658 lifetime points

```
Current Tier: SILVER (min: 500)
Next Tier: GOLD (min: 1500)
Lifetime Points: 658

pointsInCurrentTier = 658 - 500 = 158
totalPointsInTier = 1500 - 500 = 1000
progressPercentage = (158 / 1000) × 100 = 15.8%
pointsStillNeeded = 1000 - 158 = 842

Display:
  "Progress to GOLD"
  [######                                  ] 15.8%
  "842 points to go"
```

### Example 3: GOLD customer who spent points

```
Customer Journey:
1. Earned 1800 lifetime points → Upgraded to GOLD
2. Spent 1600 points (200 remaining)

Current Tier: GOLD (min: 1500) ← Stays GOLD!
Next Tier: PLATINUM (min: 3000)
Lifetime Points: 1800
Current Points: 200

pointsInCurrentTier = 1800 - 1500 = 300
totalPointsInTier = 3000 - 1500 = 1500
progressPercentage = (300 / 1500) × 100 = 20%
pointsStillNeeded = 1500 - 300 = 1200

Display:
  Current Tier: GOLD 🥇 (doesn't downgrade despite low balance!)
  "Progress to PLATINUM"
  [########                                ] 20%
  "1200 points to go"
```

## 🔧 Backend Changes

### File: `backend/src/routes/loyalty.js`

**Added tier minimum constants:**

```javascript
const tierMinimums = {
  BRONZE: 0,
  SILVER: 500,
  GOLD: 1500,
  PLATINUM: 3000,
};
```

**Updated progress calculation:**

```javascript
// Calculate points needed for next tier
// Progress should be relative to current tier, not from zero
const currentTierMin = tierMinimums[customer.loyaltyTier] || 0;
const nextTierMin = nextTier ? tierMinimums[nextTier] || 0 : currentTierMin;

// Points needed = points required within current tier range
const pointsInCurrentTier = lifetimePoints - currentTierMin;
const pointsNeededInTier = nextTierMin - currentTierMin;
const pointsStillNeeded = Math.max(0, pointsNeededInTier - pointsInCurrentTier);
```

**Updated API response:**

```javascript
tier: {
  current: customer.loyaltyTier,
  multiplier: currentTierConfig.pointsMultiplier,
  discountPercentage: currentTierConfig.discountPercentage,
  birthdayBonus: currentTierConfig.birthdayBonus,
  next: nextTier
    ? {
        tier: nextTier,
        minimumPoints: nextTierMin,
        pointsNeeded: pointsStillNeeded,        // NEW: Points still needed in current tier
        progressPoints: pointsInCurrentTier,     // NEW: Points earned in current tier
        totalPointsInTier: pointsNeededInTier,   // NEW: Total range of current tier
      }
    : null,
}
```

---

## 🔧 Frontend Changes

### File: `frontend/src/components/loyalty/LoyaltyDashboard.tsx`

**Updated to use backend's calculated values:**

```typescript
if (tierData.next) {
  // Use backend's calculated values if available
  if (tierData.next.progressPoints !== undefined && tierData.next.totalPointsInTier !== undefined) {
    // Backend provided relative progress values
    const pointsInCurrentTier = tierData.next.progressPoints;
    const pointsNeededForNextTier = tierData.next.totalPointsInTier;
    pointsToNextTier = tierData.next.pointsNeeded || 0;

    if (pointsNeededForNextTier > 0) {
      progressPercentage = (pointsInCurrentTier / pointsNeededForNextTier) * 100;
    }
  } else {
    // Fallback: calculate from lifetime points
    pointsToNextTier = Math.max(0, tierData.next.pointsNeeded || 0);
    const pointsInCurrentTier = lifetimePoints - currentTierMin;
    const pointsNeededForNextTier = nextTierMin - currentTierMin;

    if (pointsNeededForNextTier > 0) {
      progressPercentage = (pointsInCurrentTier / pointsNeededForNextTier) * 100;
    }
  }
}
```

## 🔧 Script Changes

### File: `backend/src/scripts/updateCustomerTiers.js`

**Added "Never Downgrade" logic:**

```javascript
// Determine correct tier based on lifetime points
let qualifiedTier = "BRONZE";
if (lifetimePoints >= tierMinimums.PLATINUM) {
  qualifiedTier = "PLATINUM";
} else if (lifetimePoints >= tierMinimums.GOLD) {
  qualifiedTier = "GOLD";
} else if (lifetimePoints >= tierMinimums.SILVER) {
  qualifiedTier = "SILVER";
}

const currentTier = customer.loyaltyTier;

// Tier order for comparison (NEVER downgrade!)
const tierOrder = ["BRONZE", "SILVER", "GOLD", "PLATINUM"];
const currentTierIndex = tierOrder.indexOf(currentTier);
const qualifiedTierIndex = tierOrder.indexOf(qualifiedTier);

// Only upgrade if qualified tier is HIGHER than current tier
const shouldUpgrade = qualifiedTierIndex > currentTierIndex;
const correctTier = shouldUpgrade ? qualifiedTier : currentTier;

if (shouldUpgrade) {
  // Upgrade customer
  await prisma.customer.update({
    where: { id: customer.id },
    data: { loyaltyTier: qualifiedTier },
  });
} else if (qualifiedTierIndex < currentTierIndex) {
  console.log(`🔒 Would downgrade to ${qualifiedTier}, but KEEPING ${currentTier} (tiers never go down!)`);
}
```

## 📋 Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: New Customer Earning Points

**Customer starts at BRONZE:**

```
Lifetime: 0 → Tier: BRONZE
Progress: 0% to SILVER (500 points to go)
```

**Earns 250 points:**

```
Lifetime: 250 → Tier: BRONZE
Progress: 50% to SILVER (250 points to go)
```

**Earns 300 more (550 total):**

```
Lifetime: 550 → Tier: SILVER 🥈 (auto-upgraded!)
Progress: 5% to GOLD (950 points to go)
  Calculation: (550 - 500) / (1500 - 500) = 50 / 1000 = 5%
```

---

### Scenario 2: Customer Spending Points

**Customer at SILVER with 800 lifetime:**

```
Lifetime: 800
Current: 800
Tier: SILVER
Progress: 30% to GOLD (700 points to go)
```

**Spends 600 points:**

```
Lifetime: 800 (doesn't change!)
Current: 200 (available balance)
Tier: SILVER (never downgrades!)
Progress: 30% to GOLD (700 points to go - unchanged!)
```

**Key Point:** Progress is based on **lifetime**, not current balance!

---

### Scenario 3: Edge Case - Customer at Max Tier

**Customer at PLATINUM:**

```
Lifetime: 5000
Current: 100
Tier: PLATINUM 💎
Progress: N/A (max tier reached)
Display: No progress bar shown
```

Even if they spend all points (0 remaining), they stay PLATINUM forever!

## 🎯 Expected UI Behavior

### For Saddaul Siam (658 lifetime, 23 current, SILVER tier):

**Before Fix:**

```
Current Tier: BRONZE ❌
Progress to SILVER: 0 points to go (already qualified!)
```

**After Fix:**

```
Current Tier: SILVER 🥈 ✅
Available Points: 23
Lifetime Points: 658

Progress to GOLD
[######                                  ] 15.8%
842 points to go

Your Benefits:
✓ Earn 1.25x points on purchases
✓ Discount: 5% on all items
✓ Birthday bonus: 100 points
```

**Calculation:**

```
Current Tier: SILVER (min: 500)
Next Tier: GOLD (min: 1500)
Lifetime: 658

Points in SILVER tier = 658 - 500 = 158
Total points in SILVER tier = 1500 - 500 = 1000
Progress = 158 / 1000 = 15.8%
Points to GOLD = 1000 - 158 = 842
```

---

## ✅ Verification Steps

### 1. Test Tier Never Downgrades

```bash
cd backend
node src/scripts/updateCustomerTiers.js
```

**Expected Output:**

```
Customer: Saddaul Siam (ID: 2)
  Current Points: 23
  Lifetime Points: 658
  Current Tier: SILVER
  Qualified Tier: SILVER
  ✅ Tier is correct

# If customer had fewer lifetime points:
Customer: Test User (ID: X)
  Current Points: 500
  Lifetime Points: 300
  Current Tier: SILVER
  Qualified Tier: BRONZE
  🔒 Would downgrade to BRONZE, but KEEPING SILVER (tiers never go down!)
```

### 2. Test Progress Calculation

**Open browser console and check:**

```javascript
Parsed Data: {
  lifetimePoints: 658,
  currentTier: "SILVER",
  currentTierMin: 500,
  nextTier: "GOLD",
  nextTierMin: 1500,
  pointsToNextTier: 842,
  pointsInCurrentTier: 158,
  progressPercentage: "15.80%"
}
```

**Verify Math:**

- Points in current tier: 658 - 500 = 158 ✅
- Total tier range: 1500 - 500 = 1000 ✅
- Progress: 158 / 1000 = 15.8% ✅
- Points to go: 1000 - 158 = 842 ✅

### 3. Test Customer Spending Points

1. Customer at SILVER with 658 lifetime, 23 current
2. Redeem 20 points
3. Check:
   - Current points: 3 ✅
   - Lifetime points: 658 (unchanged) ✅
   - Tier: SILVER (unchanged) ✅
   - Progress: 15.8% (unchanged) ✅
