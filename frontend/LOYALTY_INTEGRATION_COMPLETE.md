## üîß Technical Implementation

### **State Management**

**POSPage.tsx:**

```typescript
const [showRedeemPointsDialog, setShowRedeemPointsDialog] = useState(false);
const [loyaltyDiscount, setLoyaltyDiscount] = useState(0);
const [pointsUsed, setPointsUsed] = useState(0);
```

**CustomersPage.tsx:**

```typescript
const [viewingCustomer, setViewingCustomer] = useState<Customer | null>(null);
const [activeTab, setActiveTab] = useState<"overview" | "loyalty">("overview");
```

### **Total Calculation**

**Before:**

```typescript
const total = calculateTotal(cart);
```

**After:**

```typescript
const total = calculateTotal(cart);
const finalTotal = total - loyaltyDiscount;
```

The `finalTotal` is used for:

- Payment modal
- Split payment dialog
- Cash validation
- Change calculation

### **Event Handlers**

**handlePointsRedeemed:**

```typescript
const handlePointsRedeemed = (discountAmount: number, points: number) => {
  setLoyaltyDiscount(discountAmount);
  setPointsUsed(points);
  setShowRedeemPointsDialog(false);
  toast.success(`Applied $${discountAmount.toFixed(2)} loyalty discount!`);
};
```

**handleClearCart:**

```typescript
const handleClearCart = () => {
  if (confirm("Clear the entire cart?")) {
    setCart([]);
    setLoyaltyDiscount(0); // Clear loyalty discount
    setPointsUsed(0); // Reset points
  }
};
```

### **Payment Integration**

Both `processPayment` and `handleConfirmSplitPayment` were updated to:

1. Use `finalTotal` instead of `total`
2. Clear loyalty discount after successful payment
3. Reset points used counter
