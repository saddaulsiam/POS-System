### Scenario: Partial Return with Store Credit

**Original Sale:**

```json
{
  "id": 123,
  "receiptId": "REC-20241001-0123",
  "customerId": 5,
  "items": [
    { "id": 45, "productId": 10, "name": "Product A", "quantity": 3, "unitPrice": 20.0 },
    { "id": 46, "productId": 11, "name": "Product B", "quantity": 2, "unitPrice": 15.0 }

}
```

**Customer Returns:**

- 2 units of Product A (opened but unused)
- 1 unit of Product B (damaged in transit)

**API Call:**

```bash
POST /api/sales/123/return
Authorization: Bearer <admin-token>

{
  "items": [
    {
      "saleItemId": 45,
      "quantity": 2,
      "condition": "OPENED"
    },
    {
      "saleItemId": 46,
      "quantity": 1,
      "condition": "DAMAGED"
    }
  ],
  "reason": "Customer dissatisfied with quality, one item damaged",
  "refundMethod": "STORE_CREDIT",
  "restockingFee": 2.00,
  "notes": "Customer preferred store credit for future purchase"
}
```

**System Actions:**

1. **Validate Return Period** ‚úÖ

   - Sale date: Oct 1, Today: Oct 3 ‚Üí 2 days (within 30-day policy)

2. **Calculate Refund:**

   - Product B (DAMAGED): No stock change ‚Üí `ADJUSTMENT` movement (waste tracking)

4. **Loyalty Points:**

   - Original points: 99
   - Refund percentage: $55/$99 = 55.6%
   - Deduct: 99 √ó 0.556 = 55 points
   - Create `ADJUSTED` transaction: -55 points

5. **Store Credit:**

   - Create `LoyaltyReward`:
     - Type: STORE_CREDIT
     - Value: $53.00
     - Expires: Apr 3, 2025 (6 months)
     - Description: "Store credit from return RET-20241003-0001"

   - Negative amounts: -$53.00
   - Payment method: STORE_CREDIT
   - Payment status: PENDING (until credit used)

7. **Update Original Sale:**

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "Return period expired" Error

**Problem:** Cannot return items after X days

**Solution:**

1. Check `.env` file: `RETURN_POLICY_DAYS=30`
2. Adjust value as needed (e.g., `60` for 60 days)
3. Restart server
4. For special cases, admin can override by adjusting sale creation date (not recommended)

---

### "Cannot return more than originally purchased" Error

**Problem:** Trying to return quantity that exceeds available

**Solution:**

1. Check return history: `GET /api/sales/:id/returns`
2. Review already-returned quantities
3. Adjust return request to remaining available quantity
4. Example: Bought 5, returned 3 ‚Üí can only return 2 more

---

### Points Deduction Not Working

**Problem:** Loyalty points not being deducted on return

**Solution:**

1. Verify original sale has `pointsEarned > 0`
2. Verify sale has `customerId` (not guest sale)
3. Check `PointsTransaction` table for ADJUSTED entry
4. Verify customer loyalty balance updated

---

### Store Credit Not Created

**Problem:** Store credit not appearing in customer account

**Solution:**

1. Verify `refundMethod: "STORE_CREDIT"` in request
2. Verify sale has `customerId`
3. Check `LoyaltyReward` table:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM LoyaltyReward
   WHERE rewardType = 'STORE_CREDIT'
   AND customerId = X
   ORDER BY createdAt DESC;
   ```
4. Verify reward hasn't expired (6 months validity)

---

### Stock Not Restocking

**Problem:** Returned items not added back to inventory

**Solution:**

1. Check item condition in request:
   - **NEW/OPENED**: Stock should increment ‚úÖ
   - **DAMAGED/DEFECTIVE**: Stock should NOT change ‚ùå (by design)
2. Verify `StockMovement` records created:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM StockMovement
   WHERE reference = '<original-receipt-id>'
   AND movementType IN ('RETURN', 'ADJUSTMENT');
   ```
3. Check product/variant stock quantity directly

---

## üìà Performance Considerations

**Transaction Safety:**

- All operations wrapped in Prisma transaction
- Rollback on any failure
- Atomic stock updates

**Database Impact:**

- Creates 1 Sale record (return)
- Creates N SaleItem records
- Creates N StockMovement records
- Creates 1 LoyaltyReward (if store credit)
- Creates 1 PointsTransaction (if loyalty)
- Updates 1 Sale record (original)
- Updates N Product/ProductVariant records

**Recommended Indexes:**

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_sale_receiptId ON Sale(receiptId);
CREATE INDEX idx_sale_notes_gin ON Sale USING gin(to_tsvector('english', notes));
CREATE INDEX idx_stockMovement_reference ON StockMovement(reference);
```

## üìö Developer Notes

### Code Quality

- Comprehensive validation and error handling
- Transaction-safe operations
- Detailed error messages
- Complete audit trail
- JSDoc comments

### Business Logic Highlights

1. **Partial Return Tracking**: Prevents over-returning by tracking cumulative returns
2. **Proportional Calculations**: Points, discounts calculated proportionally
3. **Condition-Based Stock**: Different stock handling per item condition
4. **Automatic Loyalty Integration**: Points and store credit fully automated
5. **Audit Trail**: Every return linked to original sale and processing employee

### Integration Points

- **Option 2**: ParkedSale (can park return-in-progress)
- **Option 3**: Loyalty system (points deduction, store credit rewards)
- **Option 4**: Inventory (stock movements, adjustments)
- **Option 6**: Receipts (generate return receipt, email customer)
